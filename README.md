Terraria tModLoader mod that adds achievements for world modes/special seeds to the in-game list.

## Restrictions
- Enforced Progression (e.g. you can't use post-Moon Lord items before defeating Moon Lord, etc.)
- No Journey Mode
- No Celebrationmk10 Seed

## Notes
Achievements are stackable (e.g. earning an achievement on Legendary Mode would also earn the equivalent achievements for Expert/Master Mode). However, it is recommended to work your way up if you are a newer player.
